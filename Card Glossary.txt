Perfect, this is exactly the point where it helps to see real cards.

Below is a **20-card “alpha set”**: 4 cards per School, spells only (no Conjurations), each using some of the 8 effects you defined.

I’ll first restate the effect keywords very briefly, then list the cards grouped by School.

---

## Effect Keywords (quick reference)

You already know these, but here’s the shorthand I’ll use on cards:

* **DRAIN X** – When this spell deals **Vitality damage** to a wizard, you gain X Vitality.
* **TORMENT** – If the target wizard has **5 or less Will after this resolves**, apply the extra “Torment” text.
* **CHANNEL X** – The **next spell** you cast this turn costs X less Soulfire (to a minimum of 1).
* **BURN X** – That wizard gains a Burn X marker: *at the start of their next turn, they take X Vitality damage*.
* **WARD X** – Until end of turn, the next time this wizard would take Vitality damage, prevent X of that damage.
* **RITUAL — [cost]** – You may pay the additional cost when casting this spell. If you do, use the upgraded effect instead.
* **HAUNT — [text]** – While this card is in your Void, you may **exile** it to use the Haunt effect once.
* **INSIGHT X** – Look at the top X cards of your deck. You may discard any number of them, then put the rest back on top in any order.

---

### 21. Crimson Cut

**School:** Blood
**Type:** Attack Spell
**Cost:** 1

**Text:**
Deal 2 damage to any wizard.

---

### 22. Blood Tithe

**Cost:** 2

**Text:**
Deal 2 damage to any wizard.
You lose 1 Vitality.
**DRAIN 2** (When this spell deals Vitality damage to a wizard, you gain 2 Vitality.)

---

### 23. Veil Severance

**School:** Shadow
**Type:** Attack Spell
**Cost:** 2

**Text:**
Dispel up to 2 Hexes attached to any wizards.
For each Hex dispelled this way, its controller loses 1 Will.

---

### 24. Night Whisper

**School:** Shadow
**Type:** Attack Spell
**Cost:** 1

**Text:**
Target wizard discards 1 card.
You lose 1 Will.

---

### 25. Firebolt

**School:** Flame
**Type:** Attack Spell
**Cost:** 2

**Text:**
Deal 3 damage to any target.

**Role:** Bread-and-butter burn. This is the straightforward “rate check” card for Flame decks—no Burn markers, no card filtering, just solid damage that fits cleanly anywhere on the curve.

---

### 26. Purging Flame

**School:** Flame
**Type:** Attack Spell
**Cost:** 2

**Text:**
Dispel target Hex.
Then deal 2 damage to that Hex’s controller.

**Role:** Flame’s aggressive answer to long-term curses. You scorch a Hex off the board and turn its backlash into direct damage, helping burn decks punch through Hex-heavy control strategies.

---

### 27. Grave Purge

**School:** Grave
**Type:** Attack Spell
**Cost:** 1

**Text:**
Dispel target Hex.
Its controller loses 1 Will.

**Role:** A very lean Grave-style answer to Hexes that also nudges the Will race. It slots neatly into slower, attrition-focused decks that want to keep the board clear while quietly eroding the opponent’s mind.

---

### 28. Bone Chill

**School:** Grave
**Type:** Attack Spell
**Cost:** 1

**Text:**
Target wizard loses 1 Will.
If that wizard has 3 or more cards in their Void, they lose 1 additional Will.

**Role:** Simple Will poke that scales with game length and Void activity. Early it’s a small ping; later it becomes a clean 2-Will hit for a single Soulfire in the kinds of grindy games Grave wants.

---

### 29. Hexbreak Edict

**School:** Hex
**Type:** Attack Spell
**Cost:** 2

**Text:**
Choose a wizard. Dispel up to 2 Hexes attached to that wizard.
That wizard gains **WARD 2** until end of turn.

**Role:** Flexible protection / reset button. Most often you’ll cast it on yourself to clear bad Hexes and gain a temporary Ward shield, but it can also be used politically in future multiplayer variants or to strip off “beneficial” Hexes later in the card pool.

---

### 30. Hex of Weariness

**School:** Hex
**Type:** Hex
**Cost:** 1

**Text:**
Attach to an enemy wizard.
At the end of that wizard’s turn, if they did not cast a spell this turn, they lose 1 Will.

**Role:** A very basic but sneaky tax on passivity. It pressures opponents who want to bank cards or Soulfire, forcing them to choose between playing suboptimal spells or slowly bleeding Will over multiple turns.
