# Gothic Duel – Effects Glossary

This section defines the nine named effects used in Gothic Duel.
Each entry describes how the effect works on cards and includes explicit limits and stacking rules.

---

## 1. Drain

**Rules Definition**
**Drain N** – When this spell deals **Vitality damage** to a wizard, its controller **gains N Vitality**.
* Drain only cares about **Vitality damage dealt by this spell**.
* If the spell deals no Vitality damage (only Will damage, or other effects), Drain does nothing.
* If the spell damages multiple wizards at once, it still triggers **once per resolution** of that spell.
* Gained Vitality cannot push a wizard below 0 or beyond any maximum allowed by rules or card text.
**Limits and Restrictions**
* Drain triggers only from **damage dealt during resolution of that spell**; it does not track later effects or delayed damage.
* Drain does not trigger from **Burn**, **Torment**, or other separate damage sources, even if they originate from the same card name.
* In the core rules, Drain never triggers more than **once per casting** of a given spell.

---

## 2. Torment
**Rules Definition**
**Torment X** – After this spell resolves, if the enemy wizard’s **current Will is X or less**, apply the Torment effect printed on the card.
* Torment checks the opponent’s Will **after** all normal effects of the spell have been applied.
* Each card using Torment specifies its own threshold **X** (for example, Torment 7, Torment 5, Torment 3).
* Torment is part of the same resolution; if the threshold is met, the Torment text happens immediately.
**Limits and Restrictions**
* Torment always checks the **single opposing wizard** in the game’s default two-player rules.
* Torment only checks **once per resolution** of the spell. If multiple steps within the spell affect Will, they all happen before the single Torment check.
* If the enemy wizard’s Will is above the listed threshold after the spell resolves, the Torment text has **no effect**.

## 3. Channel
**Rules Definition**
**Channel N** – The next spell the controller casts this turn costs **N less Soulfire**, to a minimum of **1 Soulfire**.
* When a Channel effect resolves, it sets up a **temporary cost reduction**.
* The reduction applies to the **next spell** that player casts **during that same turn**.
* This reduction modifies only **Soulfire cost**; additional costs (Vitality, Will, discards, etc.) are unchanged.
* A spell’s Soulfire cost cannot be reduced below **1**, unless a card explicitly states otherwise.
**Limits and Restrictions**
* If multiple Channel effects are active for a player at the same time, only the **single highest N** applies to the next spell; all lower Channel reductions are ignored for that spell.
* After a spell has been cast using any Channel reduction, **all pending Channel reductions for that player are cleared**.
* Channel effects do not carry over to future turns; any unused Channel at the end of the turn is lost.

## 4. Burn
**Rules Definition**
**Burn N** – A wizard with Burn N suffers **N Vitality damage at the start of that wizard’s turn**, as specified by card text.
* When a wizard gains a **Burn N** marker:
  * If that wizard already has a Burn marker with the **same N**, those markers combine into a single Burn marker with value **N + N** (for example, Burn 2 plus Burn 2 becomes Burn 4).
  * Burn markers with **different N values** are tracked separately.
* At the **start of that wizard’s turn**, each Burn marker on that wizard deals its listed damage.
* The persistence of Burn (whether it is removed after triggering or remains) is determined by card text.
**Limits and Restrictions**
* Unless a card states otherwise, a Burn marker is **removed after it deals damage once**.
* Burn always deals **Vitality damage** unless card text explicitly changes the type of damage.
* Burn damage is applied after start-of-turn Soulfire refresh, but before the Draw Phase.
* Burn can be prevented or reduced by effects such as **Ward**, following the general damage rules.

---

## 5. Ward
**Rules Definition**
**Ward N** – Prevent the next **N damage** that would be dealt to this wizard **this turn**.
* Ward creates a **temporary damage shield**.
* Each time this wizard would take Vitality or Will damage, that damage is reduced by up to the remaining Ward amount.
* Once Ward has prevented a total of **N damage**, it is removed.
**Limits and Restrictions**
* Under the core rules, a wizard can only benefit from **one source of Ward per turn**:
  * If a wizard already has any amount of Ward during a turn, additional Ward gained that same turn has **no further effect**, unless a card explicitly allows it to stack.
* Ward applies to any damage type (Vitality or Will) unless the card granting Ward restricts it (for example, “Ward 3 against Vitality damage”).
* Ward expires at the **end of the turn** in which it was gained, even if it did not prevent its full amount of damage, unless the card states a longer duration (“until your next turn,” etc.).

## 6. Ritual
**Rules Definition**
**Ritual – [alternative cost]: [Ritual effect]**
A spell with Ritual is cast in one of two modes:
1. **Base mode** – pay the normal cost and resolve the base text, or
2. **Ritual mode** – pay the Ritual cost instead and resolve the **Ritual text**, which replaces the base text.
* Ritual is always a **replacement mode**.
* When Ritual mode is chosen, the base effect of the spell does **not** occur, unless the card specifically says that it does.
**Limits and Restrictions**
* Only a single mode is chosen when a spell with Ritual is cast; this choice is made as part of casting the spell and cannot be changed later in the resolution.
* The Ritual cost may include Soulfire, Vitality, Will, or other requirements; all listed costs must be paid or the spell cannot be cast in Ritual mode.
* A spell using Ritual mode still counts as **one spell cast**, for any effects that care about “spells cast this turn” or similar language.

## 7. Haunt
**Rules Definition**
**Haunt –** A card with Haunt can be used once from its owner’s **Void**, during that owner’s Main Phase, by exiling it from the Void to apply the printed Haunt effect.
* When a card with Haunt is in its owner’s Void, it can be activated once more from that zone.
* To activate Haunt:
  * The card is **exiled from the Void** (removed from the game).
  * The Haunt effect printed on the card then resolves.
**Limits and Restrictions**
* Each physical copy of a card can have its Haunt effect activated **only once per game**, because it is exiled as part of the cost.
* Under the core rules, **a player may activate Haunt at most once per turn**, regardless of how many Haunt-capable cards are in that player’s Void.
* Haunt can be activated only during the controller’s **Main Phase**, unless a card grants a different timing window.
* Haunt follows normal targeting and legality rules; if all targets are illegal at resolution, the effect fizzles and the card remains exiled.

## 8. Insight
**Rules Definition**
**Insight N** – Look at the top **N cards** of your deck. Then put those cards back on top of the deck in any order.
* Insight lets a player reorder upcoming draws without changing hand size.
* If the deck contains fewer than N cards, the player looks at and rearranges **all remaining cards** in the deck.
**Limits and Restrictions**
* Insight never directly draws cards unless a card specifically combines Insight with drawing.
* If Insight is used when the deck is nearly empty, normal **reshuffle and Will-loss rules** apply later when a draw effect actually occurs; Insight itself does not reshuffle the deck.
* After an Insight effect resolves, the new top-of-deck order remains in place until changed by another effect or by drawing cards.

---

## 9. Dispel
**Rules Definition**
**Dispel** removes ongoing card-based effects from play, typically Hexes and buffs.
Common text patterns include:
* “Dispel target Hex.”
* “Dispel up to N Hexes from target wizard.”
* “Dispel all Hexes and ongoing buffs.”
When a card is **dispelled**:
* Remove that card from the battlefield or from being attached.
* Place it into its owner’s **Discard**, unless a card or rule specifies another destination.
* Any continuous or repeating effects from that card end immediately.
**Limits and Restrictions**
* Dispel affects only **ongoing card-based effects** that remain in play (such as Hexes and future buff-type permanents).
* Dispel does **not** retroactively cancel one-shot effects that have already resolved.
* Dispel does not inherently remove **status markers** such as Burn or Ward; such markers are removed only if an effect explicitly says it can remove them.
* If a single effect attempts to Dispel more targets than exist (for example, “Dispel up to 3 Hexes” when only 1 Hex is present), it removes as many legal targets as possible and then finishes resolving.
