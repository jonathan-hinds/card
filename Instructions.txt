# GOTHIC DUEL – INSTRUCTION MANUAL (UPDATED)

## 1. Overview
Gothic Duel is a fast-paced card game for **2 players**.
Each player is a dark wizard using forbidden magic to destroy the other’s **body** and **mind**.
Each wizard has:
* **20 Vitality** – physical life
* **10 Will** – sanity, mental stability
Wizards cast spells using **Soulfire**, their magical energy.
A player **loses** the game immediately if:
* Vitality is reduced to **0**, or
* Will is reduced to **0**.
Games are designed to be short, typically ending in around **10 turns** total.

---

## 2. Components
Each player uses:
1. **Wizard board or card**
   * Tracks current **Vitality**
   * Tracks current **Will**
   * Tracks markers such as **Burn**, **Ward**, and attached **Hexes**
2. **Deck of 20 cards**
   * The wizard’s spellbook
   * Contains Spells and Hexes from various Schools of magic
3. **Trackers or UI elements**
   * **Soulfire** (current and maximum)
   * **Status markers** (Burn, Ward, etc.)

---

## 3. Card Types
### 3.1 Spells
* One-shot effects: damage, healing, resource manipulation, card filtering, and so on.
* After a Spell resolves, it is placed into its owner’s **Discard** unless the card text says otherwise.
### 3.2 Hexes
* Ongoing **curses** that attach to a wizard (self or enemy).
* A Hex remains in play and continues to apply its effect until:
  * It is **dispelled**,
  * It **expires** due to its own rules, or
  * The game ends.

---

## 4. Zones
Each player manages several zones:
1. **Deck**
   * Face-down pile from which cards are drawn.
2. **Hand**
   * Cards currently held and available to play.
   * Default maximum hand size is **7**.
   * At the end of each turn, if a player has more than 7 cards in hand, that player discards down to 7.
3. **Discard**
   * Face-up pile of used or destroyed cards that are no longer in play.
4. **Void**
   * Face-up pile of cards that have been **removed from normal play** (exiled).
   * Some effects, such as **Haunt**, can still use cards in the Void.
   * **Both players may inspect all cards in either Void at any time.**
5. **In Play**
   * Attached Hexes and any other ongoing card effects that remain on the table.

---

## 5. Setup

1. Each player chooses or is assigned a **Wizard** and places it in front of them.
2. Each player shuffles their **20-card deck** and places it face down as their Deck.
3. Randomly determine who will take the **first turn**.
4. Each player draws an opening hand of **5 cards**.
5. **Second-player compensation:**
   * The player who goes **second** draws **1 additional card** (starting with **6 cards** in hand).
   * The player who goes **first** skips the **Draw Phase of their first turn** (does not draw a card on that first turn).
6. Each wizard starts with:
   * **20 Vitality**
   * **10 Will**
   * **Maximum Soulfire = 3**
   * **Current Soulfire = 3**
Vitality, Will, and Soulfire values **never go below 0**.
If an effect would reduce a value below 0, that value remains at 0 instead.

---

## 6. Soulfire

### 6.1 Maximum and Current Soulfire
Each wizard has:
* **Maximum Soulfire** – the cap for how much Soulfire can be held.
* **Current Soulfire** – what is available to spend on spells during the turn.
At the beginning of each of that player’s turns:
1. Maximum Soulfire increases by **1**, up to a maximum of **10**.
2. Current Soulfire is then set to equal Maximum Soulfire.
Soulfire is primarily spent to **pay Spell and Hex costs**.
Additional costs (such as paying Vitality or Will) are always listed on the card.

---

## 7. Turn Structure
On a player’s turn, the following sequence is used.
### 7.1 Start of Turn
In this order:
1. **Increase Maximum Soulfire**
   * Increase Maximum Soulfire by **1**, up to a maximum of **10**.
2. **Refresh Current Soulfire**
   * Set Current Soulfire equal to Maximum Soulfire.
3. **Resolve “Start of Turn” effects**
   * Resolve all effects that state “**At the start of your turn…**”.
   * If multiple such effects are waiting (Burn, Hexes, etc.), the active player chooses the order in which their own effects resolve.
   * Damage and other changes are applied immediately.
   * If Vitality or Will is reduced to **0** at this time, the wizard loses the game immediately.

### 7.2 Draw Phase
* Normally, the active player **draws 1 card** from their Deck.
* On the game’s very first turn, the first player **does not draw** during this phase.
#### Deck Reshuffle and Will Loss
When a player must draw a card and that player’s Deck is empty, perform a **Reshuffle**:
1. **Gather cards to reshuffle**
   * Collect all of that player’s cards that are:
     * In that player’s **Discard**,
     * In that player’s **Void**,
     * In play as ongoing cards (such as attached Hexes).
   * Do **not** gather cards currently in the player’s hand or the wizard card itself.
2. **End all ongoing effects from those cards**
   * Any Hexes or other ongoing cards removed from play this way stop applying their effects.
3. **Form a new Deck**
   * Shuffle all gathered cards together.
   * Place them face down as the player’s new Deck.
4. **Draw the required card**
   * The player then draws the card(s) that were being drawn when the Deck was found to be empty.
Once a player has performed a Reshuffle at least once during the game:
* That player loses **1 Will at the end of each of their turns** in which that player **drew at least one card from their Deck** during that turn (including the draw that immediately followed the Reshuffle).
* This Will loss is **once per turn**, regardless of how many cards were drawn that turn.
There is no immediate automatic loss for running out of cards.
Instead, the Reshuffle restores access to played cards, while the ongoing Will loss pressures the game toward a conclusion.

### 7.3 Main Phase
During the Main Phase, the active player may:
* Play **Spells** and **Hexes** by paying their costs.
* Use abilities printed on cards that allow use during the Main Phase (such as **Haunt** from the Void).
* Take actions in any order, as long as costs and targeting rules are followed.
* End the turn.
There are **no instant-speed spells** and **no stack**:
* Cards and abilities can **only** be played during the controlling player’s own Main Phase, unless a card explicitly states otherwise.
* Once a Spell or ability is played and its costs are paid, it resolves immediately in the order it was played.

### 7.4 End Phase
At the end of the active player’s turn:
1. Resolve any “**At the end of your turn…**” effects.
2. Check hand size:
   * If the player has more than **7** cards in hand, that player discards down to 7.
3. If the player has previously reshuffled and drew at least one card from the Deck this turn, that player **loses 1 Will** (see Reshuffle rules).
4. The turn ends and the opposing player becomes the active player.

## 8. Damage, Healing, and Loss

### 8.1 Vitality and Will
* Damage to Vitality reduces the wizard’s **physical life**.
* Damage to Will reduces the wizard’s **sanity and resolve**.
* Healing effects restore Vitality or Will up to their starting values:
  * Vitality cannot exceed 20 unless a card specifically allows it.
  * Will cannot exceed 10 unless a card specifically allows it.
* Vitality and Will never go below 0.
* A wizard loses the game immediately if Vitality or Will reaches **0**.
### 8.2 Damage Prevention and Modification
Before damage is applied:
1. Apply any prevention effects (such as **Ward**) or reductions specified by cards.
2. Apply remaining damage to the appropriate value (Vitality or Will).
Effects such as **Burn**, **Torment**, **Drain**, and others modify how damage is dealt and resolved; details appear in the **Effects Glossary**.

---

## 9. Targeting and Illegal Targets
* When playing a Spell or Hex requiring a target, a legal target must be chosen as part of the casting.
* If all chosen targets become illegal before resolution (for example, by leaving play or gaining immunity), the effect **fizzles** and does nothing.
* If an effect has multiple targets and some remain legal:
  * The effect resolves as much as possible on the remaining legal targets.

---

## 10. No Instants or Reactions (Turn Structure Philosophy)
Gothic Duel uses a simple, front-facing timing structure:
* No instant-speed cards are present in the core rules.
* No reactive play occurs during an opponent’s turn unless a special rule or future card type explicitly introduces it.
* Planning, resource management, and visible board state are intended to be the main sources of depth, rather than hidden timing tricks.
